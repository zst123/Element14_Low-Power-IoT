            emWin operates incorrectly with a floating point when a project
            is compiled with IAR or ARM Compiler 6 within MbedOS. <br>
            This is caused by the inconsistent floating-point ABI selection
            between toolchains in MbedOS: <br>

        </td>
        <td>
            To avoid the incorrect operation, use one of the following workarounds: <br>
            1. Use the GCC toolchain for MbedOS emWin projects. <br>
            2. Manually replace the emWin softfp library with its hardfp version.
               For example, for NOSNTS emWin core variant and IAR toolchain, replace the library in 
               <br> GUI/COMPONENT_SOFTFP/COMPONENT_EMWIN_NOSNTS/TOOLCHAIN_IAR <br>
               with the library from
               <br> GUI/COMPONENT_HARDFP/COMPONENT_EMWIN_NOSNTS/TOOLCHAIN_IAR.
