# CY8CKIT-028-TFT shield support library
The TFT Display Shield Board (CY8CKIT-028-TFT) has been designed such that a TFT display, audio devices, and sensors can interface with PSoC MCUs.

See [README.md](README.md) for details on how to use this library.

### What's Included?
This library includes support for each of the hardware components included on the shield:

* 2.4 inch TFT Display (ST7789V)
* Motion Sensor (BMI-160)
* Ambient Light Sensor (TEMT6000X01)
* PDM Microphone example code (SPK0838HT4HB)
* Audio Codec (AK4954A) (not yet supported in this library)

### What Changed?
#### v1.2.0
* Reworked how object initialization/freeing is done.
#### v1.1.0
* Added support for motion sensor
* Added support for light sensor
* Reorganized TFT code into separate sub library
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release supporting the TFT display only

### Supported Software and Tools
